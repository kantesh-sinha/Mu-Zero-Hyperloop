2. Description of System/Component (ITD, FDD)
The pod relies on the amalgamation of various types of sensors necessary for state estimation as well as active control and safe operation during a run. Sensors capture and translate the physical attributes in and around the pod into observable electrical impulses which are then relayed to the microprocessor through the sensor ECU. Around thirty different sensors collect information about the position, angular/ linear orientation of the pod, the temperature of various subsystems and pneumatic pressure of the brakes. The three major categories of sensors used in the pod are position/navigation aid, temperature and pressure sensors. The navigation aid sensors play a major role in state estimation which is used to develop a precise and reliable system for position tracking. The combined data received from sensors allow the pod to follow a predefined trajectory profile that specifies a position-dependent speed. To achieve this, the estimation of the pod√¢s state, consisting of its position, velocity, and acceleration, as well as a high-level control is needed. The aim for the sensor infrastructure is to facilitate autonomous functioning allowing active control of the pod at all points during the run which is done using both analog output sensors such as pressure sensor, LIM temperature sensor, NTC10K screw-in temperature sensors and digital output sensors namely fiducial sensor and mass flow rate sensor. The sensors are controlled through two different self-developed SensorECUs placed on the front and backside of the pod and exchanged data through the CAN bus connections.
